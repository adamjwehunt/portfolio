Hey there, welcome to my little corner of the internet. I've been coding professionally for 5+ years and as an amateur for a bit longer. My old website was okay, but it lacked the crucial concept of communication! It's about time I started documenting my random musings, ideas, and the code I'm getting into. At first, my posts will probably be more journal-like, but as time goes on, I'll delve into more technical stuff. Maybe this will even turn into more of a feed to share random ideas and thoughts. Thanks for tuning in! Whether you stumbled upon this site accidentally or intentionally, thank you for stopping by! Feel free to shoot me an email at [adamjwehunt@gmail.com](mailto:adamjwehunt@gmail.com) and say hi.
