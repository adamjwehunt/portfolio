## Biography

Born in [Mesa, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona 'Mesa, Arizona Wiki'), I found my love for programming, web design, and building PCs during my high school years. In college, I created websites in my free time and earned an associates degree. After graduating, I developed a calling to work outdoors ☀️ and do hands-on activities. So, I lead a team laying solar panels across the valley as a fun and meaningful job, it allowed me to make a positive impact on the environment 🌱.

Eventually, I sped up my passion for by joining a coding bootcamp 🪖 to jumpstart my skills at building modern web apps. I then joined [Faithlife](https://www.faithlife.com), a huge bible software company, as a Full Stack Engineer. I contributed to a variety of projects including TV apps for Roku, Amazon Fire, AppleTV, and web, as well as front-end web projects and desktop applications.

Following my time at Faithlife, I took a break to travel and share quality time with my wife and daughter. Currently, I work remotely based in [Flagstaff, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona 'Flagstaff, Arizona Wiki').

## Day-to-day

I spend my days in the forest of Flagstaff, Arizona 🌲🌲🌲. Here I feel lucky to code with aspens quaking outside my window and a view of the forest from my back porch.

When away from the screen, I love taking a step outside. Whether it's going on a hike, bike ride, or camping with my family, I find comfort in nature and feel energized by the calm 🧘 it gives. And when I'm not exploring the outdoors, I'm with my family, either at the playground, playing video games, working on a DIY project, or whatever our imagination brings.

After TLO (the little one) goes to bed, I'm hanging out on the couch with my wife. She's an amazing person and artist, who is usually drawing on the Ipad (see her work [here](https://www.instagram.com/marisariveraart/ 'Marisa Rivera (@marisariveraart)')). I'm probably coding (lately, I've been planning out games for my daughter). Other times, painting miniatures for tabletop games 🧐🎨. And if I'm on my PC, I'm playing [Starcraft 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II 'Starcraft 2 PC Game'). For me, it's all about creating, learning something new, or simply having a good laugh.

I **cherish** the freedom of working remote. I love being outside the hustle and bustle- there is a special sort of clarity it brings. I share more of the day with my family, and feel closer to my community. It's a simple and fulfilling life that I am grateful to be living. 🎉
