## Biography

Born in [Mesa, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona 'Mesa, Arizona Wiki'), I found my love for programming, web design, and building PCs during my high school years. In college, I created websites in my free time and earned an associates degree. Upon graduation, I developed a calling to work outdoors ‚òÄÔ∏è and engage in more hands-on activities. So, I oversaw a team installing solar panels across the valley as a fun and meaningful endeavor, as it allowed me to make a positive impact on the environment üå±.

Eventually, I accelerated my passion by joining a coding bootcamp to jumpstart my skills at building modern web apps. I then joined [Faithlife](https://www.faithlife.com), the largest bible software company on Earth, as a Full Stack Engineer. I contributed to a variety of projects including TV apps for Roku, Amazon Fire, AppleTV, and web, as well as front-end web projects and desktop applications.

Following my time at Faithlife, I took a break to travel and share quality time with my wife and 2-year old daughter. Currently, I work remotely based in [Flagstaff, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona 'Flagstaff, Arizona Wiki').

## Day-to-day

I spend my days in the serene forest of Flagstaff, Arizona üå≤. Here, I feel incredibly fortunate to code with aspens rustling outside my window and a view of the forest from my back porch.

When I take a break from coding, I love taking a step outside. Whether it's going on a hike, bike ride, or camping with my wife and child, I find comfort in nature and feel energized by the calm it provides. And when I'm not exploring the outdoors, I spend my time with my family, either at the playground, playing video games, working on a DIY project, and whatever our imagination brings.

After we put TLO (the little one) to bed, I'm hanging out on the couch with my wife. She's an amazing artist who spends her time drawing on the iPad (you can check out her work on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marisariveraart/ 'Marisa Rivera (@marisariveraart)')). Meanwhile, I like to keep myself busy with a few different hobbies. Sometimes, I'll be coding (Lately, I've been planning out games for my daughter.). Other times, I might be indulging in my high school hobby of painting miniatures for tabletop games üé®. In addition to that, I'll scroll through Reddit and YouTube, and listen to podcasts. Whether it's expanding my knowledge on a certain subject or simply having a good laugh, I find these activities to be a great way to unwind after a long day.

I cherish the freedom and flexibility of working remote. I love being able to escape the hustle and bustle, there is a special sort of clarity it brings. Here, I can stargaze at night and wake up to the sound of birds chirping in the morning. It's a simple and fulfilling life that I am grateful to be living. üéâ
